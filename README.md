# Interpretable Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines with Automatic Rank and Feature Selection

[![Source Code License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL-blueviolet)](https://github.com/afrakilic/BTN-Kernel-Machines/blob/main/LICENSE)


This repository contains the source code used to produce the results obtained in [Interpretable Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines with Automatic Rank and Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12789) submitted to [Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://www.jmlr.org/). This project sets fixed random seeds to promote reproducibility. All experiments were conducted on the following computer:

- **Device**: MacBook Pro (Model Identifier: Mac14,9)
- **Chip**: Apple M2 Pro 
- **Memory**: 16 GB LPDDR5
- **Operating System**: macOS 15.5 (Build 24F74)

However, please note that some computations may still yield slightly different results across operating systems (e.g., macOS vs Windows), hardware architectures, or Python library versions.


In this work we propose a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on Tensor Network factors to automatically infer tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability.
